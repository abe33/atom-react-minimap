# Public: The `Minimap` package provides an eagle-eye view of text buffers.
#
# It also provides API for plugin packages that want to interact with the
# minimap and be available to the user through the minimap settings.
#
# ## Events
#
# * `activated` -
#      Emitted synchronously when the package is activated. By suscribing
#      to this event other packages can be notified of the activation of the
#      minimap. At that point the minimap views have been created.
#
# * `deactivated` -
#      Emitted synchronously when the package have been deactivated. The views
#      are no longer available at that point.
#
# * `minimap-view:created` -
#      Emitted synchronously when a {MinimapView} have been created for
#      an active {PaneView}.
#      Your handler will be called with an object containing the following keys.
#      * `view`: The {MinimapView} that was created
#
# * `minimap-view:will-be-destroyed` -
#      Emitted synchronously when a {MinimapView} is about to be destroyed.
#      Your handler will be called with an object containing the following keys.
#      * `view`: The {MinimapView} that was created
#
# * `minimap-view:destroyed` -
#      Emitted synchronously when a {MinimapView} was destroyed, at that point
#      the view have been removed from the DOM.
#      Your handler will be called with an object containing the following keys.
#      * `view`: The {MinimapView} that was created
#
# * `plugin:added` -
#      Emitted synchronously when a minimap plugin was registered.
#      Your handler will be called with an object containing the following keys.
#      * `name` - The {String} name used to register the plugin
#      * `plugin` - The plugin {Object} that was registered
#
# * `plugin:removed` -
#      Emitted synchronously when a minimap plugin was unregistered.
#      Your handler will be called with an object containing the following keys.
#      * `name` - The {String} name used to register the plugin
#      * `plugin` - The plugin {Object} that was unregistered
#
# * `plugin:activated` -
#      Emitted synchronously when a minimap plugin was activated.
#      Your handler will be called with an object containing the following keys.
#      * `name` - The {String} name used to register the plugin
#      * `plugin` - The plugin {Object} that was activated
#
# * `plugin:deactivated` -
#      Emitted synchronously when a minimap plugin was deactivated.
#      Your handler will be called with an object containing the following keys.
#      * `name` - The {String} name used to register the plugin
#      * `plugin` - The plugin {Object} that was deactivated
